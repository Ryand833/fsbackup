One backup script
-----------------------
The backup script does a full copy into a directory


Three restore scripts
-----------------------
1) Full system restore -- guided command-driven restore script to do a full system restore to bare-metal

2) Curses-based GUI for individual file/dir restore inside the OS

3) Command-line argument script for individual file/dir restore inside the OS
   May potentially combine this with script #2
